# JavaScript Challenges
I noticed that my JavaScript is still leagues behind my HTML/CSS, so I'm taking on any challenge I come across to level up.

# How It's Made:
*Tech used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The HTML/CSS is minimal because I want to highlight my JavaSript skills. But as a designer first, it has to look good.
 
<!-- # Optimizations
(optional)*
 
ou don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but lso functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
 
# Lessons Learned:
 
o matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have hose *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
