        <h2 class="day">Day 05</h2>
        <h1 class="title">Flex Gallery</h1>
        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          For today's prompt, we created a flex gallery, meaning the images are equally distributed across the width of
          the page, and when clicked, animates to be a little bigger than the rest. There is also more text that
          transitions into the image.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to follow along with this video and used the starting file this time mostly because I didn't want to
          have to look for the images myself. Looking at the HTML and CSS, the images are all in a <code>.panels</code>
          container, and each <code>.panel</code> has a different background. There is styling to center the images and
          for the transitions we will be adding.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>Most of the actual transitions are done with CSS, but we need JavaScript to listen to the events that trigger
          the transitions, such as clicking the image we want to expand. By adding the <code>.open</code> and
          <code>.open-active</code> classes to a panel, it will show the targeted image as bigger than the rest as well
          as show the initially hidden text.
        </p>
        <p>In the JavaScript, we have event listeners for the click, to enlarge the image with <code>.open</code>, and
          when this transition ends, to show the hidden text.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This was a nice short and sweet exercise today, and coincidentally, I was working on flex box on another
          exercise to show a photo gallery with a modal/lightbox for when the images are clicked. I have just dived into
          learning more about the <code>display: flex</code> and <code>flex-direction</code> properties, which I believe
          forms the basis for frameworks like Bootstrap. I find it’s a lot more helpful and useful when you get a better
          understanding of how things work under the hood instead of taking it as it is.</p>
