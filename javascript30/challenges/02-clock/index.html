        <h1 class="title">Clock</h1>
        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Today's prompt is an analog clock, which seems simple enough, but I don't actually know how to transform
          elements to rotate like that. A quick Google search tells me that there is indeed a transform property with
          the rotate value; you can even specific
          the axis upon which it's rotating. This brings me back to high school, sitting in math class calculating the
          conversion of an angle's degree measurement to hours-minutes-seconds. Good times! I think it will probably be
          relevant here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking through how it should work, this is what I came up with:
        <ul>
          <li>Get the time from the browser</li>
          <li>Get the hours, minutes, and seconds</li>
          <li>Convert those numbers to rotations needed for transform property</li>
          <li>Apply rotations as the time updates</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Right now, I know how to get the time from the browser, and with some quick math I can determine how to get
          the rotation conversions, but actually applying the JavaScript to do that is where I'm at a lost. In
          particular, how will it always know what time it is? Do I just keep making calls to get the current time?</p>
        <p>And that's what we're here to find out.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>Per usual, I tried the problem without watching the full video first. This means setting up the HTML and CSS,
          and then going through the JavaScript docs to look for what might be useful.</p>
        <p>I found the setInterval function that allows for running functions every set interval that you set. That
          solved my biggest point of confusion, so the rest was fairly easy. Doing some quick math gave me a formula for
          calculating the degrees that the hands would be rotating at. The only thing is that with hours, you would
          divide by 12 instead of 60 for seconds and minutes. A small blip was accounting for the 90 degrees that I'd
          used to shift the hands to start at the 12.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>For the most part the clock works now. However, there are issues in the way when the hands reach 0 or the 12,
          they rotate all the way backwards to start again instead of just ticking forward. I wasn't sure how to fix it
          and didn't want to invest too much more time in this one, so I left it here for now. If I were to extend it, I
          would also want to add the numbers to the clock to increase readability. I just displayed the actual time in
          the title for now.</p>
