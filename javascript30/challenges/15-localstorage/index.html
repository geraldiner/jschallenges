        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          For today’s problem we worked with a to do list style tapas menu that featured local storage and event
          delegation. This meant that even if the user refreshed the page, you would still see the list from the last
          session. Event delegation is an interesting
          term. Going in I had no idea what it meant, but just from the words it sounded like distributing events to
          different listeners or functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a lot like the to do list you create in the <a href="https://www.watchandcode.com"
            target="_blank">Watch and Code</a> course, so the actual application was familiar to me. However, local
          storage and event delegation are not.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The solution for the local storage was quite simple. I didn’t know <code>localStorage</code> was a thing, and
          I think the key thing to remember is that when being stored, it needs a <code>string</code>, so you can use
          <code>JSON.stringify</code>. And then when you need to access the data again,
          you use <code>JSON.parse</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the event delegation, Wes compares it to a parent who tells its child what to do. In this case, there is
          an event listener on the entire list of items, but we only want to pay attention to what’s happening with the
          inputs. I actually do remember this
          from Watch and Code as well. There was an event listener on the entire list, but only if the target was the
          Delete button would we actually delete the item that was clicked on. It seems to be similar here.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Greatest thing I learned today was listening to a ‘submit’ event! You can catch all the types of submission
          (clicking submit, pressing enter, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it was also helpful to learn about <code>localStorage.</code> I can see myself using this for projects
          that are using an API that can get rate limited. Instead of constantly making API requests, I can store the
          information in <code>localStorage</code> and access it from
          there.
