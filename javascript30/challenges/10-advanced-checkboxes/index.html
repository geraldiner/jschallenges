        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Today’s project is to be able to check one item, and then by holding down the <code>Shift</code> key, you can
          check a lower item, and it will check everything in between. I’ve put together a todolist before, so that part
          is not bad. I took Wes’s starting HTML and
          CSS for convenience and have been thinking about how to go about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something I use a lot in the Adobe CC, so it was cool to figure out how it works. What I first thought
          is that we want to know which item on the list got checked first, then find out which item on the list got
          checked second, and then everything
          in between gets checked. So if item 1 got checked first, and item 5 got checked next, there would be some kind
          of for loop or iterator that goes from 2-4 to check the items in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had no idea how to do this in JavaScript, but I tried it without watching the video first anyway!
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>I got about as far as getting all the inputs and putting an event listener on them. I started trying
          different combinations of listening to when the <code>Shift</code> key was held down and setting the inputs in
          between to ‘checked’. But I couldn’t figure out
          how to know which box was checked first and which was checked second, or what identifier to give them, so I
          could find them in the collection of inputs. Originally, I set variables ‘first’ and ‘next’ to keep track and
          used them to find them in
          the collection, so that I could iterate between them like bounds to set them as checked. But it didn’t work!
        </p>
        <p>Watching a few minutes into Wes’s solution, he used a brute-force kind of solution, where he loops over the
          entire checklist from the first item that was check. And with the <code>Shift</code> key held down, there is
          another variable inBetween that tells us
          that we’re still in between the two checked items. So before watching him code it up, I tried again to do it
          on my own first.</p>
        <p>For the most part, I got it working, but it looked really messy. There were some things in Wes’s code that
          were simplere, such as setting the inBetween to just the opposite of what it currently was, instead of a whole
          if/else to change it.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Reflection</h3>
        <p>This one was a real challenge! But I learned a lot about how to keep the code simpler and shorter to be more
          efficient. I’m also getting better at commenting my code. I’m going to try to implement this again with the
          todolist I already have and
          see how it goes.</p>
