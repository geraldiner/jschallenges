        <h1 class="title">HTML Canvas</h1>
        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Today is creating a drawing canvas in HTML, which is pretty cool. I love colors so I am easily excited about
          this one. I don’t know a lot about using the canvas in HTML, so I will be following along with the video. We
          want to start drawing once the user
          clicks the mouse. The color starts as red, but starts changing colors through the rainbow until it reaches red
          again, and it starts all over again. It also starts as a small brush size and increases in size until it
          reaches a certain size, and
          then it will start decreasing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>The only thing we needed on the HTML was the <code>canvas</code> tag set to a certain <code>width</code> and
          <code>height</code>. In JavaScript, we grabbed the canvas and set a <code>context</code> to draw on. (I had to
          look up what this all meant because I’d never heard of it before.) We have variables
          to help keep track of the mouse’s movements while it’s on the page. However, with the event listeners, it only
          draws when the mouse is being clicked.
        </p>
        <p>In our <code>draw</code> function, we use the mouse’s <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> values to
          create a path, from where it was to where it’s going. If the mouse is moving really fast, then that means the
          function is being called instantly one after the other. The colors
          come from a <code>hue</code> variable that increments with each call, as does the line <code>width</code>. But
          there is an <code>if</code> statement to check whether it’s gone to a specific size, and when it does reach
          that size, it will start getting smaller again.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>I started commenting my code so I could reiterate what was happening in each part of the code. I also think
          it’s good practice for real industry work when I need to hand off my code to someone or someone else is
          looking at the code for some reason.</p>
