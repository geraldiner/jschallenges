        <h1 class="title">Ajax Type Ahead</h1>
        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          For today's prompt, we created a search box that lists the cities that contains the text input, somewhat in
          the same way Google search allows for text completion. We are pulling from an external json file that lists
          cities and their populations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to follow along with this video and used the starting file this time because I was pressed for time.
          Usually I'd try to set up the HTML and CSS myself, but couldn't today.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>First we set up a fetch for the endpoint of the data we were using, which is a json file. With the fetch we
          attached a <code>.then</code> to turn the raw data into readable json, and another <code>.then</code> to push
          the data to our cities array.</p>
        <p>We then created a function called <code>findMatches</code> that takes in a <code>wordToMatch</code>, which is
          the text we will be matching to the items in the cities array. Using a regex with the
          <code>wordToMatch</code>, we use it in a filter to return all the matches in the cities
          array.
        </p>
        <p>Finally we have a <code>displayMatches</code> function that shows the matched items as you're typing. Again,
          we use a regex to match the <code>wordToMatch</code> that was typed in, and use that to add a class on a
          <code>span</code> to show it as highlighted.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>I really appreciate the bite-size-ness of these exercises. They're not too long and I always feel like I'm
          learning something new in such a small time frame. I'd seen <code>fetch/then</code> used before, but never
          really understood how it worked (and it
          would've been massively helpful for the <a href="https://geraldiner.com/pokemonadoption"
            target="_blank">Pokemon Adoption Site</a> I was building). I also got to work with regex more, which I
          haven't touched in a hot minute. I'm learning all these
          little things, and I'm really enjoying it!</p>
        <p>
          I think for future exercises, I will try to comment the code more, since it is a good practice to do so
          when/if I'm passing my code along to someone else. I find that it also helps me to understand what's
          happening, instead of just listening to Wes talk
          to them in the video.
