        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Checking the duration of the video, I was surprised to see that it was only about 5 minutes! It does utilize
          <code>cornify.js</code> for the extra end results, but it’s still mind-boggling to know what can be achieved
          with only a few lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this challenge, we needed a way to check the user’s keyboard input. If it matched a certain sequence, we
          could do something to make that known, which in this case is displaying unicorn images.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>
          We have two variables: an array to hold the keys that are pressed and the secret code that users are supposed
          to type in.
        </p>
        <p>
          We simply set up an event listener to check which keys are being pressed. These are pushed into the array, but
          as more keys are being pressed, the least recent keys are pushed out. This is because the array is only kept
          to the length of the secret code;
          that way it doesn’t have to store so many items. Finally, we join the keys in the array to test it against the
          secret code, and if they match, the unicorn is displayed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          This was a very simple challenge and I enjoyed it a lot. As I mentioned before, I really appreciate the
          bite-size lessons. I imagine a similar mechanism is employed on websites that check for login and password
          combinations, so it’s a great thing to learn.
