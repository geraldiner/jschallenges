        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          For this challenge I tried to do it on my own before watching the full video. I figured that you need to
          assign each button with the letter it’s supposed to be and bind it somehow to an event that listens for when
          it’s been pushed down. And when it has
          been pushed down, the sound will play. Unfortunately, I haven’t dealt with sound before or with events for
          keys being pushed down.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what I need the program to do is:
        <ul>
          <li>Set up the keys with event listeners bound to their letter</li>
          <li>When the letter is pushed down, the sound plays</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Solution</h3>
        <p>I really wanted to use Bootstrap’s <code>.button</code> class, but I am committed to the Vanilla everything.
          In building websites and web apps, I first break the page into its components, such as a container for the
          keys and the individual keys themselves, which
          I made to mimic the keyboard keys they would be bound to.</p>
        <p>Most of this was easy to put together, but when it came to formatting the buttons, I was lost on how to get
          them equally spaced from each other. Without Bootstrap, I was forced to learn <code>display: flex</code> and
          <code>justify-content: space-between</code>. It’s always
          nice to find out how things work under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>From there, I knew how I wanted the JavaScript to work, but wasn’t sure how to implement it. I consulted the
          video and learned about the data-key attribute, which you use to link the key being pressed to the sound file
          you want played. Then it was
          just a matter of accessing the elements through the DOM and writing a function to not only play the sound when
          the key is pressed, but to apply the css to differentiate it from the other keys. We also have to account for
          when the key is released,
          which means it should go back to the original state.</p>

        <h3 class="section">Reflection</h3>
        <p>As a designer, I realized that I spent way more time putting the page together than I probably needed to.
          Once the core functionality was done, I wanted to put together a Guitar Hero feel, hence the background image.
          I also chose colors from the
          background for the keys to keep the theme going. As far as JavaScript goes, this was a fun first challenge and
          I’ve already learned a lot, so I’m looking forward to the next one!</p>
