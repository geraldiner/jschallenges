        <h1 class="title">Array Cardio 1</h1>
        <h3 class="section">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Today is all about practicing <code>Array</code> methods, which is good because I think I'm really bad at it
          right now. Maybe not really bad, but I can definitely improve. I know I especially struggle when it comes to
          figuring out the best method to use and remember
          what parameters each method takes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 8 exercises in all using the <code>filter</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>map</code> and
          <code>reduce</code> methods. I've used <code>filter</code> and <code>sort</code>, but not so much
          <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section" id="solution">Solution</h3>
        <p>
          For the first exercise, using the <code>filter</code> method, I put in conditional statements for the years to
          be greater than 1499 but less than 1600 to only capture the years in the 1500's.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second exercise uses the <code>map</code> method to create a list of just the first and last names of each
          inventor. I didn't fully understand the <code>map</code> before. From my understanding it's like an assembly
          line. You give it a set of instructions to follow to build
          the elements that go into the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third exercise is a simple <code>sort</code> method that compares the years of each element to find the
          lowest to highest. I did mess up a bit when I initially thought the higher year number meant the person was
          older. But that's backwards. The lower the year
          number meant they were the older. So I just had to flip the <code>compare</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the fourth exercise I had to watch the video because the documentation wasn't making a lot of sense to me.
          I sitll don't quite fully understand how it works. It looks like a recursive function to me: a running total
          gets added the ages of all the inventors.
          And the last argument is what it starts with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise 5 is just an extension of exercise 3, except instead of the birthdate, it's the ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise 6 was an exercise for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris"
            target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>, which I completed in the console. First I got the <code>div</code> that
          all the links where in, and then took only
          the links, which were all the boulevards in that list.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
  const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category'); 
  const links = [...category.querySelectorAll(`a`)] 
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we filter the links to only get the ones with 'de' in their names, and take only the
          <code>textContent</code> of the links and put it into an array.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            var des = links.filter(link => link.textContent.includes('de')) 
  var de = des.map(d => d.textContent)
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the final result looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
            ["Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix", "Boulevard des Capucines", "Boulevard de la Chapelle", "Boulevard de Clichy", "Boulevard de l'Hôpital", "Boulevard des Italiens", "Boulevard de la Madeleine", "Boulevard de Magenta", "Boulevard de Rochechouart", "Boulevard de Sébastopol", "Boulevard de Strasbourg", "Boulevard de la Zone"]
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise 7 was a simple <code>sort</code> on the people array since they were already listed by their last
          names.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise 8 was another <code>reduce</code> challenge, so I attempted it on my own, using the previous exercise
          and Javascript documentation to guide me. At first, it was difficult because there are <code>strings</code>
          instead of <code>numbers</code>, and we have to keep track of counts for
          each string. This made me think that we probably want to use a dictionary with the <code>strings</code> as
          <code>keys</code> and <code>counts</code> as the <code>values</code>. I hit a blip when none of the keys were
          being stored, but I realized that I hadn't initialized the accumulator, and that
          fixed it up.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          These exercises really challenged me to look up the documentation for these methods. I didn't want to rely on
          the video, so I tried them on my own first. However, some of the prompts are a little vague, like, "Give us an
          array of the inventors' first and last names." Initially I thought I had to keep them as dictionary objects,
          so I ended up with an array of dictionaries, when an array of strings is important. This is why clear
          requirements documentation is important!
        </p>
        <p>
          Today was refreshing. It reminded me that sometimes working on the foundations and basics is important to keep
          moving forward. And not only did I get to work on <code>Array</code> methods, but also using the arrow
          notation and template literals.
